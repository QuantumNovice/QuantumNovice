## Remember Covid?
People (one company employee in particular) started using zoom exploits to unmute mic and cameras during the pandemic.
So, I started using virtual machines. It has a small problem (especially windows hyper V)
The audio doesn't work well. So I wrote this package to use my phone as mic, where I can physically
disable my mic.

And that's the story behind this project
